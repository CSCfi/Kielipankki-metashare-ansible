(Preliminary instructions 2013-06-27)

(1) Edit

    * cgi/queconf.py (initially copy cgi/queconf.skel)
    * ./fresh
    * ./syncmeta

    to point to the same data directory. (TODO: implement a single
    step for this.)

(2) $ ./fresh

(3) Copy (or move) cgi/que (with cgi/queconf.py) to be run as a CGI
    script.

Later:

(4) ./syncmeta can be run again to update the current database in the
    data directory.

cgi/que needs only read access to the data directory when run by a web
server, ./syncmeta and ./fresh need also write access.

./syncmeta uses lxml's XML, XSL, and now XSD machinery.
