* Two scripts

- An OAI-PMH server implements a harvesting protocol over HTTP

- We have a CGI-script for this, written in Python3

- Metadata is served from a static SQLite3 database file

- An update is done by replacing the database file with a new version

- The old database can still be accessed through a resumption token
  for a limited time.

- We have another script to update the database file from our
  META-SHARE node, written in Python3/lxml, to be run as a cron job

- *Almost* done!

* The server script

- The OAI-PMH server is a CGI script written in Python3

- Metadata is served from a static SQLite3 database file

- Resumption tokens contain the information needed to resume the
  service

- There are so few records that the resumption mechanism is not even
  used (yet?)

- Updates are atomic: create a new database file, make it current

- Advertised as transient - not sure of our ability to track all
  deletions yet

* The update script

- The server database remembers META-SHARE storage identifiers and
  checksums

- New OAI identifiers for META-SHARE records are based on their
  storage identifiers but shorter

- Checksum change indicates an update

- META-SHARE's harvesting protocol requires login credentials, then
  provides access to metadata that may not be public in the node

- We serve published META-SHARE records as such, others as deleted

- We serve META-SHARE resourceInfo, minimal Dublin Core (because
  OAI-PMH), and (minimal?) OLAC

- waiting the ability to derive corresponding CMDI directly


* Some issues

- not yet validating the META-SHARE records - needs done

- DC and OLAC are flat, resourceInfo is a component architecture

- a "managing node" would have all META-SHARE records - not sure of
  the issues there

- lack of resource identifiers as opposed to record identifiers
