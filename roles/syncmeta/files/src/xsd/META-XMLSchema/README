Established own UHEL copy of v3.0 (downloaded with wget from ilsp.gr
where the records point as the schema location) because lxml insists
that the published version contains errors:

   lxml.etree.XMLSchemaParseError:
   Element '{http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema}pattern':
   The value '[^@]+@[^\.]+\..+|' of the facet 'pattern'
   is not a valid regular expression., line 24

That pattern is in v3.0/META-SHARE-SimpleTypes.xsd and can only be
wrong (reading http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#regexs) in [^\.], so
trying to replace that with [^.]. FAILED - still "not valid". Try to
remove the trailing '|' even though the TR is clear that it's fine.
THEN THE SCHEMA IS PARSED BUT IT'S ALSO DIFFERENT!
